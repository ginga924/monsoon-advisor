The order size takes into account the current stock and provides a buffer for unexpected demand fluctuations. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is lower than the player's planned order quantity. This adjustment minimizes overstocking and reduces the risk of unsold inventory. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     |  ~ 2.5 days                               |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   |  ~ 6 days                                  |\n| Comments                          |  By adjusting the order size and taking into account current inventory, the recommended order maximizes inventory utilization and minimizes the risk of stockouts. The lower order size also reduces the risk of carrying excess inventory and potential obsolescence. | \n", "units_to_buy": 10000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "AA111", "user": "LN69130_342409", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "69130", "password": "22991"}
