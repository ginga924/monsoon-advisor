This adjustment reduces the risk of overstocking and potential obsolescence, especially given the short shelf life of 8 days. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.5                                      |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5                                         |\n| Comments                          | This recommendation takes advantage of the vendor's available order quantities and considers the current stock level, forecasted demand, and potential demand variability to minimize stockouts and ensure a healthy inventory turnover. | \n", "units_to_buy": 50000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "3", "I agree with AI advice": "2", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "2"}, "team_name": "FF 5", "user": "LN70703_350531", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "87988"}
