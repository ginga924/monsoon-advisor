Ordering in multiples of 30,000 units also minimizes the cost impact of potential stockouts, as it is a single-purchase option with a relatively low lead time. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 10,000 units lower than the player's planned purchase, potentially resulting in cost savings by reducing the bulk order discount. However, the recommended size ensures sufficient stock to meet demand. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 4.1 Days (considering the current stock level and recommended purchase) |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.7 Days (considering the current stock level and recommended purchase) |\n| Comments                          | Ordering in multiples of 30,000, even though the player was aiming for 40,000 units, ensures sufficient inventory to cover the forecasted demand with a safety buffer. It allows for a more efficient use of available stock while minimizing the risk of stockouts due to demand variability.  | \n", "units_to_buy": 40000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "3", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "FF 5", "user": "LN70703_350531", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "87988"}
