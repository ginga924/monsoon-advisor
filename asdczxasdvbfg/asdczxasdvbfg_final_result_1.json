This adjustment mitigates the risk of overstocking, considering potential demand variability. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 1.2 days                                   |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6.9 days                                   |\n| Comments                          | The current stock level of 4,000 units combined with the 30,000 units order creates a buffer for potential demand fluctuations. The recommended order size enables taking advantage of the discount while fulfilling the forecast with a margin of safety. | \n", "units_to_buy": 50000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "asdczxasdvbfg", "user": "LN69130_342410", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "69130", "password": "56652"}
