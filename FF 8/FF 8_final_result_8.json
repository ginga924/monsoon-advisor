The combination of 20,000 units (vendor option) + 471 units (current stock) provides coverage beyond the forecasted demand. This also minimizes the need for frequent reorders and takes advantage of a potential discount for ordering above the minimum purchase quantity (17,100 units).  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | Player planned 17,704 units, this recommendation is 2,296 units higher. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.35 days                               |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5 days                                     |\n| Comments                          | The recommended order size will allow for sufficient stock on hand over the next 5 days, even with potential deviations in the forecasted demand. This strategy minimizes risk of stockouts and allows for a faster turnover rate compared to the player's plan. | \n", "units_to_buy": 17704, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "FF 8", "user": "LN70703_350534", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "78278"}
