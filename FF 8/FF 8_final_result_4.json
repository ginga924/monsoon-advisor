This quantity also allows for optimal use of vendor order quantities, preventing unnecessary excess inventory.   |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size exceeds the player's planned order size, indicating a need to proactively secure inventory to ensure sufficient stock levels. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3 days (calculated based on the recommended order size and forecasted demand) |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5 days (based on the forecasted demand)   |\n| Comments                          | This recommendation balances the need to meet demand with the risk of overstocking. By ordering 15,000 units, we are able to meet forecasted demand for the next 5 days while also having a buffer in case demand exceeds expectations. This approach helps minimize stockouts and optimizes inventory turnover. | \n", "units_to_buy": 3652, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "6", "I agree with AI advice": "6", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "6"}, "team_name": "FF 8", "user": "LN70703_350534", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "78278"}
