This order size avoids exceeding the minimum purchase quantity threshold for the discount, preventing unnecessary inventory build-up and potential stock obsolescence. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommendation is less than the player's planned order size of 6881 units. This is a more conservative approach that accounts for potential demand fluctuations and avoids overstocking.  |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.2 days                               |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.6 days                               |\n| Comments                          | The recommended order size, combined with the current inventory level, ensures a robust buffer to manage demand fluctuations and avoids potential stockouts. This approach prioritizes meeting sales demand and avoids unnecessary inventory holding costs, optimizing inventory turnover. | \n", "units_to_buy": 6881, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "6"}, "team_name": "FF 8", "user": "LN70703_350534", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "78278"}
