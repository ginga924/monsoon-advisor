It also balances the risk of stockouts with the cost of carrying excess inventory. | \n", "units_to_buy": 40000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "567", "user": "LN69130_342410", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "69130", "password": "56652"}
