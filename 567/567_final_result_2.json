This order size also allows for a potential discount on the order due to it exceeding the minimum purchase quantity.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The player has planned to purchase 0 units, which would not be sufficient to cover demand. This recommendation ensures sufficient stock is available, minimizing the risk of stockouts. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | Approximately 2.4 days                    |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6 days                                      |\n| Comments                          | This recommendation utilizes two vendor order quantities of 15,000 units. This approach allows for a potential discount and avoids exceeding the shelf life limit. | \n", "units_to_buy": 0, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "567", "user": "LN69130_342410", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "69130", "password": "56652"}
