This is a multiple of the vendor's available order quantities (40,000 + 5,000) and will enable the player to reach the target stock level while also taking advantage of the discount threshold. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size matches the player's planned order quantity, ensuring the discount threshold is met. However, it does not rely on the exact forecasted sales figure. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 1.1 days                               |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.2 days                               |\n| Comments                          | This recommendation considers the player's current stock level and the lead time to ensure timely stock replenishment. Ordering in multiples of the vendor's available order quantities allows for flexibility and helps to optimize the stock level for the next 5 days. | \n", "units_to_buy": 45000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "asdczxzc", "user": "LN69130_342410", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "69130", "password": "56652"}
