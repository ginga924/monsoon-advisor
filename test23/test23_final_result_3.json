It leverages available vendor order quantities while minimizing excess inventory. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The player plans to purchase 0 units, which would likely lead to stockouts. This recommendation significantly increases inventory to cover forecasted demand. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | ~2.5 days                              |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5 days                                    |\n| Comments                          |  The current stock level is insufficient to meet projected demand, and a large order is necessary to avoid stockouts. This recommendation provides a buffer for demand fluctuations and leverages vendor order quantity options effectively. | \n", "units_to_buy": 0, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "3", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "test23", "user": "LN70702_350549", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70702", "password": "27062"}
