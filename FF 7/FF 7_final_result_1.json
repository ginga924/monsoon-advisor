Ordering 20,000 units will ensure sufficient inventory for the next 6 days, factoring in a 1-day lead time and potential demand fluctuations. This allows for a safe buffer and avoids potential stockouts. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | Player planned to order 0 units, while the recommended order size is 20,000 units. This is a significant adjustment, but it is necessary to ensure adequate stock coverage for the forecasted demand and potential variability. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 10 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6 days                                   |\n| Comments                          | The recommended order size of 20,000 units can be achieved by ordering 2 x 10,000 units. While the player planned to order 0 units, the recommendation ensures stock availability for the next 6 days, minimizing stockouts and maximizing sales opportunities. | \n", "units_to_buy": 0, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "FF 7", "user": "LN70703_350533", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "17310"}
