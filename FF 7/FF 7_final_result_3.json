This order, when combined with the current stock, will provide ample coverage for the forecasted demand while leaving sufficient buffer for potential demand spikes. Ordering multiple smaller quantities (e.g., two 10,000 unit orders) may be more advantageous, allowing for flexibility in responding to demand fluctuations.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | Player planned to purchase 0 units.
