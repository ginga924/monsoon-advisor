This also avoids any potential stockouts and allows for better control over inventory turnover. The order size is also the largest available below the minimum purchase quantity threshold for the discount, minimizing potential waste and ensuring the stock is replenished before the shelf life expires. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The player's planned purchase of 0 units would leave the current stock insufficient to cover the forecasted demand, creating a high risk of stockouts. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | Approximately 2.17 days                   |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 2.17 days                               |\n| Comments                          | This order quantity ensures sufficient stock while also considering the shelf life, the minimum purchase quantity threshold, and the lead time. This approach minimizes waste and maximizes inventory turnover, ensuring the business can meet its sales goals without carrying excess inventory. | \n", "units_to_buy": 0, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "FF 7", "user": "LN70703_350533", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "17310"}
