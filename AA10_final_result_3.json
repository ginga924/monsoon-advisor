While this exceeds the player's planned units to buy, adjusting the order size to this recommendation offers several benefits:\n\n* **No Stockouts:** The increased order size helps prevent stockouts, ensuring that customer demand is met throughout the forecasted period.\n* **Faster Stock Turnover:** The higher inventory level will result in a faster stock turnover rate of 5.39 days, leading to improved inventory management efficiency.\n* **Buffer for Unexpected Demand:** The additional stock provides a buffer for any unexpected fluctuations in demand, reducing the likelihood of stockouts during peak periods.", "units_to_buy": 15000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "AA10", "user": "LN69130_342409", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "69130", "password": "22991"}
