To account for potential fluctuations in demand and avoid stockouts, a safety stock is added. Considering a safety stock of 2,581 units (12.5% of forecasted demand) ensures a buffer against unforeseen demand spikes.\n* **Current Stock:** The current stock level of 8,868 units will be depleted in the next 5 days. \n* **Discount Threshold:** The minimum order quantity of 21,300 units qualifies for a 13% discount. This discount significantly reduces the overall cost of restocking.\n* **Vendor Order Quantities:** The most efficient way to reach the desired restock level is to order 20,000 units and an additional 3,000 units. This combination maximizes the discount and satisfies the minimum order threshold.\n\n**Benefits of Adjustment:**\n\n* **Improved Stock Availability:** By increasing the order size by 3,000 units, the inventory can cover forecasted demand for a longer duration (10 days) and provide a buffer against potential demand fluctuations. This reduces the risk of stockouts and ensures product availability for customers.\n* **Reduced Stockouts:** The higher safety stock level (2,581 units) significantly mitigates the risk of stockouts, ensuring smooth operations and a seamless customer experience.\n* **Efficient Inventory Turnover:** Ordering in bulk minimizes the number of orders required to meet demand, leading to improved inventory turnover, reduced storage costs, and optimized warehouse space utilization.\n* **Discount Advantage:** The combined order of 20,000 units and 3,000 units achieves the minimum purchase quantity for the discount, resulting in significant cost savings. \n", "units_to_buy": 20000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "6", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "FF 2", "user": "LN70703_350528", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "95320"}
