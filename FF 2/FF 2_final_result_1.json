This accounts for the forecasted demand of 83,217 units over the next 5 days, the current stock level of 41,829 units, and a 1-day lead time. This order size also allows for multiple vendor order quantities to be purchased (e.g., four 10,000 units orders), maximizing the discount potential.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is slightly higher than the player's planned 41,388 units. This adjustment helps ensure adequate inventory to meet forecasted demand, considering potential demand fluctuations. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | Approximately 2.5 days                    |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5 days                                     |\n| Comments                          |  The recommended order size ensures enough stock to meet forecasted demand and avoid stockouts. Ordering in multiples of 10,000 units provides flexibility and potential discounts. | \n", "units_to_buy": 41388, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "FF 2", "user": "LN70703_350528", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "95320"}
