It also allows for a buffer in case of unexpected surges in demand.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 5,000 units higher than the player's planned order quantity. This adjustment aims to reduce the risk of stockouts and improve the likelihood of meeting all demand. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.5 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6 days                                    |\n| Comments                          | This order size avoids the minimum purchase quantity threshold for the discount, however, it optimizes stock levels for demand coverage. | \n", "units_to_buy": 3000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "AA2222", "user": "LN69130_342410", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "69130", "password": "56652"}
