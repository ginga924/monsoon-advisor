It also provides the opportunity for a potential discount due to the minimum purchase quantity. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 5,000 units higher than the player's planned purchase, which accounts for potential sales fluctuations and ensures sufficient stock availability over the next 5 days. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.75 days                                 |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.5 days                                  |\n| Comments                          | This recommendation considers current stock levels and potential demand variability. Multiple vendor order quantities were evaluated to ensure a combination that meets the forecasted demand and minimizes leftover stock. The order size allows for potential discount benefits while maintaining an optimal stock level. |\n", "units_to_buy": 10000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "5", "I agree with AI advice": "6", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "DD 6", "user": "LN70433_348920", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "13719"}
