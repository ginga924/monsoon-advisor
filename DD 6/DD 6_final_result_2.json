It also allows for multiple purchases of the 10,000 unit minimum to achieve the required stock level while achieving the discount. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     |  The recommended order size is 10,000 units higher than the player's planned purchase. This adjustment provides a more robust safety net and ensures the ability to meet demand even if it exceeds the forecast. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     |  3.4                                       |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   |  7.0                                       |\n| Comments                          | The recommended order size leverages the discount threshold while maintaining a strong buffer against demand variability. This approach optimizes cost efficiency without compromising stock availability.  | \n", "units_to_buy": 10000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "5", "I agree with AI advice": "5", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "DD 6", "user": "LN70433_348920", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "13719"}
