Ordering 38,000 units (3x12,000 + 2x1,000) provides a larger safety stock and better aligns with the available vendor order quantities.  |\n\n", "units_to_buy": 30000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "5", "I agree with AI advice": "5", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "DD 6", "user": "LN70433_348920", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "13719"}
