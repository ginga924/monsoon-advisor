This exceeds the forecasted demand of 46,020 units, creating a buffer for potential demand fluctuations.\n* **Discount Maximization:** Ordering 28,000 units allows for achieving the discount threshold of 21,100 units, enabling a 12% discount on the entire order, maximizing cost savings.\n* **Minimizing Excess Stock:** Ordering in multiples of 8,000 units allows for flexibility while minimizing excess inventory. This minimizes the risk of overstocking, reducing storage costs and potential obsolescence.\n* **Balancing Demand and Stock Levels:** The recommended order size balances the need to meet anticipated demand while considering the lead time and shelf life, minimizing the risk of stockouts and maximizing inventory turnover.\n\n**Benefits of Adjusting Order Size:**\n\n* **Improved Inventory Turnover:** Ordering a smaller quantity, specifically tailored to cover projected demand, reduces the risk of overstocking and accelerates inventory turnover.\n* **Reduced Stockouts:** The buffer created by exceeding forecasted demand helps mitigate potential fluctuations and minimizes the risk of stockouts.\n* **Optimized Cost Savings:** Utilizing the discount threshold with a strategic order size maximizes savings and optimizes overall inventory costs. \n", "units_to_buy": 40000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "3", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "FF10", "user": "LN70703_350536", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "28021"}
