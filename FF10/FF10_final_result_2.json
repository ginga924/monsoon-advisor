This quantity allows for multiple orders within the available vendor order quantities and achieves a good balance between covering demand and managing inventory levels.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | 8,000 units higher than the player's planned order, providing a more robust buffer against demand variability. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | ~3.8 days                             |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6.2 days                              |\n| Comments                          | By increasing the order size, we can ensure sufficient stock availability for the next five days and beyond, minimizing the risk of stockouts and potential lost sales. This approach also considers the possibility of slightly higher demand than predicted, providing an additional safety margin. The chosen order size allows for multiple purchases within the available vendor order quantities, reducing the need for large single orders and allowing for better inventory management over the longer term. | \n", "units_to_buy": 20000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "FF10", "user": "LN70703_350536", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "28021"}
