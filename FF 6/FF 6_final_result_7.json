It also allows for flexibility to accommodate potential sales fluctuations. | \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Forecasted Demand:** The forecasted demand of 27,158 units needs to be adjusted to account for potential variability. A margin of error of 10% is added, resulting in a projected demand of 29,874 units. \n* **Current Stock:** The current stock of 3,077 units needs to be factored into the calculation.\n* **Lead Time:** With a lead time of 1 day, the order needs to be placed today to ensure the stock arrives before the forecasted demand.\n* **Vendor Order Quantities:**  To achieve the required stock level, multiple vendor order quantities can be combined. The recommended order size of 35,000 units can be achieved by ordering two batches of 15,000 units and one batch of 5,000 units. \n\n**Benefits of Adjusting Order Size:**\n\n* **Meeting Sales Demand:** The adjusted order size ensures sufficient stock to meet the projected demand, even with potential fluctuations.\n* **Reducing Stockouts:**  The increased order size minimizes the risk of stockouts and ensures continued customer satisfaction.\n* **Improving Inventory Turnover:** By adjusting the order size to account for the current stock and forecasted demand, the inventory turnover is optimized, leading to a more efficient use of resources. \n", "units_to_buy": 30000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "5", "I agree with AI advice": "5", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "FF 6", "user": "LN70703_350532", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "19424"}
