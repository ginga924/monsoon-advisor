Multiple orders of 30,000 units were considered as they are the closest to the required level while staying below the player's planned purchase and taking advantage of the discount threshold. This approach allows for flexibility in adjustments based on actual sales and avoids stockouts while promoting efficient inventory management. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommendation is 10,000 units less than the player's planned purchase,  potentially reducing excess stock and improving cash flow.  |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     |  4.7                                      |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   |  5.2                                      |\n| Comments                          |  The 1-day lead time allows for timely replenishment. Consider closely monitoring sales in the next few days and adjust future orders as needed.  | \n", "units_to_buy": 50000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "6", "I agree with AI advice": "6", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "6"}, "team_name": "DD 7", "user": "LN70433_348921", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "94175"}
