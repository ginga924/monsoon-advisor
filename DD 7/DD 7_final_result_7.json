By ordering slightly more than the player's planned purchase, it accounts for potential demand fluctuations and minimizes the risk of stockouts. |\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Current Stock + Player's Order:** The current stock of 16,172 units combined with the player's planned 20,000 units totals 36,172 units. This amount is sufficient to cover the forecasted demand of 49,799 units over the next 5 days, but leaves a very small margin of error.\n* **Demand Variability:** Forecasting is never perfect, and actual demand might be higher than predicted, leading to stockouts.\n* **Vendor Order Quantities:** By combining two vendor order quantities (12,000 + 13,000 = 25,000), we achieve a greater stock level without unnecessarily exceeding demand. \n* **Stock Turnover:** Ordering 25,000 units results in a more balanced stock turnover, ensuring efficient utilization of inventory while keeping enough on hand to meet demand.\n* **Lead Time:**  The lead time of 1 day is manageable, but ordering a slightly larger quantity provides a buffer against unexpected delays or disruptions.\n* **Shelf Life:** The shelf life of 8 days provides ample time to utilize the ordered units, minimizing potential waste.\n\n**Overall, adjusting the order size to 25,000 units offers a more strategic approach by balancing stock levels with demand variability, maximizing stock turnover, and minimizing the risk of stockouts.** \n", "units_to_buy": 20000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "5", "I agree with AI advice": "6", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "6"}, "team_name": "DD 7", "user": "LN70433_348921", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "94175"}
