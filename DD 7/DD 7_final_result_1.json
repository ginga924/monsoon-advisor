This ensures a sufficient safety stock to avoid potential stockouts, allowing for slight fluctuations in actual demand. Additionally, ordering 20,000 units allows for a discount, enabling a more cost-effective approach. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is significantly lower than the player's planned 50,000 units. This adjustment avoids overstocking and reduces potential waste due to the 8-day shelf life. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.3 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 8 days                                    |\n| Comments                          | This recommendation leverages the existing stock, reducing the need for a large order size and optimizing inventory turnover. By placing multiple orders of 20,000 units instead of a single large order, the discount can be maximized and inventory levels managed efficiently. | \n", "units_to_buy": 50000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "2", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "2"}, "team_name": "DD 7", "user": "LN70433_348921", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "94175"}
