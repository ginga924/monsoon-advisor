It avoids overstocking and potential spoilage due to the product's 8-day shelf life. Additionally, it allows the player to take advantage of the discount by reaching the minimum purchase quantity threshold. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is lower than the player's planned order of 50,000 units. This adjustment helps avoid overstocking and potentially exceeding the shelf life of the product.  |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 4.04 days                                |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.57 days                                |\n| Comments                          | The recommended order size allows for a 5.57-day demand coverage, providing a buffer against demand fluctuations. Ordering multiple 20,000 units can help achieve the player's planned order quantity if desired. | \n", "units_to_buy": 50000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "2", "I agree with AI advice": "2", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "3"}, "team_name": "DD 7", "user": "LN70433_348921", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "94175"}
