This will bring the total inventory to 64,552 units.  This will ensure enough units to meet the forecasted demand for the next five days while also allowing for a buffer to account for potential demand variability. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | This recommendation is 5,000 units less than the player's planned purchase. This adjustment is made to minimize unnecessary inventory and achieve a better balance between supply and demand. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3.4 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.2 days                                  |\n| Comments                          |  While the discount for ordering above 15,500 units is tempting, ordering only 15,000 units provides a more conservative approach to inventory management. This strategy minimizes the risk of overstocking, reduces storage and holding costs, and maintains a healthy stock turnover. | \n", "units_to_buy": 20000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "DD3", "user": "LN70433_348917", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "79246"}
