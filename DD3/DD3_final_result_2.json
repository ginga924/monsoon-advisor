This quantity also allows for the efficient utilization of the vendor's order size options, minimizing potential overstocking. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 5,000 units less than the player's planned order, reducing the risk of overstocking and potential obsolescence, especially considering the 8-day shelf life. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3.5 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 7.7 days                                  |\n| Comments                          | By leveraging the current stock level and ordering in increments of 15,000 units, we can cover the predicted demand with a safety margin, avoiding potential stockouts. This approach also allows for a faster turnover rate compared to ordering a larger quantity. | \n", "units_to_buy": 20000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "DD3", "user": "LN70433_348917", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "79246"}
