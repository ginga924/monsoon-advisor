This approach balances meeting demand with minimizing stock holding costs and potential obsolescence due to shelf life. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The player has not planned to order any units. This recommendation helps to avoid potential stockouts by proactively replenishing inventory based on forecasted demand.  |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 10 days (Calculated: Current Stock / Average Daily Demand) |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 7 days (Calculated: Current Stock + Recommended Order Size / Forecasted Demand) |\n| Comments                          | The recommended order size accounts for the lead time of 1 day and anticipates slight variations in sales. It is also aligned with a vendor order quantity that allows for efficient replenishment. This approach helps to optimize inventory levels and minimize stockouts. | \n", "units_to_buy": 0, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "FF3", "user": "LN70703_350529", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "68071"}
