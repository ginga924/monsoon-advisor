Ordering in multiples of 40,000 will allow for flexibility in meeting demand over longer periods and potentially taking advantage of volume discounts. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     |  The recommended order size is 5,000 units higher than the player's planned order size. This adjustment aims to mitigate potential demand fluctuations and avoid stockouts. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     |  ~ 1.67 days                             |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   |  5 days                                     |\n| Comments                          |  The recommended order size takes into account the current stock level (0 units), forecasted demand, lead time, and shelf life. It ensures a sufficient buffer to handle potential demand fluctuations and avoid stockouts. While the discount threshold is not reached with this order size, the potential for higher demand and the desire to minimize stockouts outweigh the discount benefit. | \n", "units_to_buy": 35000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "FF3", "user": "LN70703_350529", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "68071"}
