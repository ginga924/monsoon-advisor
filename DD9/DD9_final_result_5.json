Recommended order size is more realistic to meet demand without excess inventory. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.1 days                               |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.3 days                               |\n| Comments                          | Multiple vendor order quantities of 10,000 and 10,000 are used to reach the recommended order size. |\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Forecasted Demand and Margin of Error:** The predicted demand is 14,866 units over 5 days. To account for potential demand variations, a margin of error is factored in, which is calculated based on historical sales data or industry trends. This margin of error is added to the forecasted demand to determine the optimal order quantity.\n\n2. **Current Stock and Lead Time:**  The current stock of 996 units can cover a part of the forecasted demand. Taking into account the lead time of 1 day, the order needs to arrive before the first day of the 5-day period to avoid stockouts. Therefore, the order quantity needs to cover the remaining demand after the current stock is accounted for.\n\n3. **Vendor Order Quantities:**  The available vendor order quantities are utilized to ensure the order size aligns with the recommended quantity. The order size is adjusted to the closest available quantity that meets the demand requirement.\n\n4. **Discount Threshold:**  The player's planned purchase quantity exceeds the discount threshold, but the discount is not prioritized in this case. The main focus is on minimizing overstocking and ensuring stock availability.\n\n5. **Shelf Life:** The recommended order size ensures that the stock will be used within the shelf life, minimizing potential waste.\n\n**Benefits of Adjusting the Order Size:**\n\n* **Meeting Demand:**  The recommended order size provides sufficient inventory to meet the forecasted demand, reducing stockouts and ensuring customer satisfaction.\n* **Reduced Inventory:** The adjusted order size minimizes overstocking, which lowers inventory holding costs and reduces the risk of expired products.\n* **Improved Inventory Turnover:**  A lower order size leads to faster inventory turnover, indicating efficient inventory management and better utilization of resources.\n\nBy taking into account all relevant factors, this recommendation ensures that the necessary stock is available to meet the forecasted demand while minimizing overstocking and promoting efficient inventory management.\n", "units_to_buy": 20000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "DD9", "user": "LN70433_348923", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "24440"}
