To account for potential demand fluctuations, adding a buffer of 20% results in a target stock level of 13,910 units.\n* **Current Stock:** With 285 units currently available, the player needs to order an additional 13,625 units to meet the target stock level. \n* **Vendor Order Quantities:**  The closest available vendor order quantity to the target is 20,000 units. Ordering this amount provides a safety margin for unexpected demand increases. \n* **Discount Threshold:** The discount threshold of 28,600 units is not achievable with a single order. \n* **Lead Time:** Ordering 20,000 units will ensure sufficient stock available throughout the next 5 days, as it includes a day of lead time.\n* **Shelf Life:** The stock will remain fresh within its 8-day shelf life, minimizing waste. \n\n**Benefits of Adjusted Order:**\n\n* **Reduced Stockouts:** The recommended order quantity significantly reduces the risk of stockouts during the next 5 days.\n* **Improved Inventory Turnover:**  The larger order size optimizes the stock-to-sales ratio, potentially leading to a faster turnover and higher profits.\n* **Discount Optimization:** This order size allows the player to achieve the minimum quantity for the discount, leading to potential cost savings. \n\n**In summary,** the recommended order size of 20,000 units balances the need for sufficient stock to meet forecasted demand, minimizing stockouts, and capitalizing on the discount opportunity. \n", "units_to_buy": 12000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "DD9", "user": "LN70433_348923", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "24440"}
