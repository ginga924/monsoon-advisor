Using two 10,000 unit purchases aligns with the vendor's available quantities.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     |  8,000 units higher than the player's planned purchase. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     |  3.4 days                                |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   |  5 days                                   |\n| Comments                          |  The recommended order size avoids the discount threshold as the potential cost savings are insignificant compared to the risk of stockouts. The 20,000 unit purchase ensures a high coverage of the forecasted demand and provides a safety buffer for potential demand fluctuations. | \n", "units_to_buy": 12000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "DD5", "user": "LN70433_348919", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "92902"}
