This will allow for a buffer against potential demand variability and ensure sufficient stock for the 5-day period. The recommended order size aligns with the available vendor order quantity and allows for the potential of ordering multiple times to cover the full forecasted demand.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size of 15,000 units is higher than the player's planned purchase of 5,000 units. This adjustment is crucial for ensuring stock availability and mitigating the risk of stockouts, which can negatively impact sales and customer satisfaction. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 1.8 days                                   |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.5 days                                   |\n| Comments                          | Ordering 15,000 units will allow for a faster turnover of inventory while ensuring enough stock to cover forecasted demand and maintain a sufficient safety stock.  | \n", "units_to_buy": 5000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "2", "I agree with AI advice": "2", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "2"}, "team_name": "DD5", "user": "LN70433_348919", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "92902"}
