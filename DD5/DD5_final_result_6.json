It also allows for flexibility in future orders based on actual sales trends. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is slightly higher than the player's planned purchase of 31,000 units. This is due to the need to account for potential demand fluctuations and ensure adequate stock levels to prevent stockouts. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | Approximately 3.5 days                       |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5 days (with buffer)                        |\n| Comments                          | While a larger order size allows for a greater buffer, it also increases the risk of holding excess inventory. This recommendation balances the need for a sufficient safety stock with minimizing the risk of holding excess inventory. The chosen order size is also divisible into two vendor order quantities (2 x 15,000 units) for ease of procurement. | \n", "units_to_buy": 31000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "3", "I agree with AI advice": "2", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "2"}, "team_name": "DD5", "user": "LN70433_348919", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "92902"}
