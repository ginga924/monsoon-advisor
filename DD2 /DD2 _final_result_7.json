This ensures sufficient stock coverage for the next 5 days, considering a potential 10% fluctuation in demand. The order size also leverages the vendor's 3,000-unit order quantity, avoiding the need for multiple smaller orders. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 3,000 units higher than the Player's planned order, providing additional safety stock. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2 days                                      |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6 days                                      |\n| Comments                          | This strategy aims to maintain a safe stock level while potentially benefiting from a 16% discount on the entire purchase due to the 24,000 unit minimum purchase threshold.  | \n", "units_to_buy": 30000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "5", "I agree with AI advice": "5", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "DD2 ", "user": "LN70433_348916", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433 ", "password": "95368"}
