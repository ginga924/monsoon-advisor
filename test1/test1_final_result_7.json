This order size takes advantage of the vendor's available order quantities while ensuring adequate coverage for the projected demand. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 10,000 units higher than the player's planned purchase. This adjustment is necessary to provide a buffer for demand variability and ensure sufficient inventory to avoid stockouts. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 5.4 days                                 |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6 days                                   |\n| Comments                          | This order will bring the total stock level to 40,622 units after the lead time. This will cover the forecasted demand of 11,411 units over the next 5 days with a safety buffer. It is advisable to monitor actual sales to adjust future orders if necessary. | \n", "units_to_buy": 10000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "test1", "user": "LN70702_350547", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70702", "password": "97448"}
