This ensures sufficient stock for the next 5 days, considering a 1-day lead time. Ordering in multiples of 30,000 units is the most efficient way to meet the minimum purchase quantity threshold of 20,400 units, thereby maximizing the discount benefit. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size matches the player's planned order size of 30,000 units, but this is purely coincidental. This decision was made based on the forecasted demand and vendor order quantities. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 0.83 days                                   |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5 days                                      |\n| Comments                          | Current stock is 0 units, so the order size needs to be sufficient to meet demand for the next 5 days. This recommendation ensures that there will be no stockouts and provides a buffer for any unexpected demand fluctuations. | \n", "units_to_buy": 30000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "test1", "user": "LN70702_350547", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70702", "password": "97448"}
