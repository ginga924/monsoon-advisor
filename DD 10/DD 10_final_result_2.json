This order size allows for flexibility in adjusting future orders based on actual demand. Ordering multiple units of 5,000 and 15,000 units from the vendor provides this optimal amount. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is significantly lower than the player's planned order size of 100,000 units. This reduces potential overstocking and minimizes risk of inventory obsolescence. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3.85 days                                 |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.2 days                                  |\n| Comments                          | By leveraging current stock and ordering strategically, the recommendation ensures sufficient stock while preventing unnecessary overstocking.  The recommended order size helps maintain healthy inventory levels while optimizing for demand coverage and minimizing potential waste. | \n", "units_to_buy": 100000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "DD 10", "user": "LN70433_348924", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "61226"}
