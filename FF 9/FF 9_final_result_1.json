While current stock is ample for the next 5 days, purchasing 20,000 units will replenish stock before it reaches a dangerously low level and allow for multiple orders at the minimum discount threshold. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | Player planned to purchase 0 units, while the recommendation is 20,000 units. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3.7 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 7.6 days                                  |\n| Comments                          | Multiple orders of 20,000 units would be required to meet the demand threshold of 20,600 units to qualify for the discount. However, this strategy provides a healthy safety margin and ensures consistent access to the discount without overstocking. | \n", "units_to_buy": 0, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "3", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "FF 9", "user": "LN70703_350535", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70703", "password": "66013"}
