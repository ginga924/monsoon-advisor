Given a 1-day lead time, ordering 30,000 units will allow for a 5-day stock buffer even after the player's planned 30,000 units are factored in. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size aligns with the player's planned purchase, ensuring stock availability over the next 5 days with additional buffer. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | Approximately 1.5 days (based on current stock and forecasted sales). |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5 days + 3 days of safety buffer = 8 days. |\n| Comments                          | The recommendation ensures sufficient stock availability while considering a margin of error in demand forecasting.  Additionally, it aligns with the player's planned purchase, minimizing adjustments while maximizing stock availability. | \n", "units_to_buy": 30000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "DD 8", "user": "LN70433_348922", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "46251"}
