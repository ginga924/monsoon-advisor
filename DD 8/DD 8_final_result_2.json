It utilizes two available vendor order quantities (2 x 10,000 units), minimizing potential waste from exceeding shelf life. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 4,000 units higher than the player's planned purchase, providing a greater buffer against demand fluctuations. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3.7 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.8 days                                  |\n| Comments                          | Ordering 20,000 units instead of 24,000 units ensures a more balanced stock level, preventing potential overstocking and minimizing waste while maintaining sufficient buffer against demand variability. | \n", "units_to_buy": 24000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "5", "I agree with AI advice": "7 (Strongly Agree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "7 (Strongly Agree)"}, "team_name": "DD 8", "user": "LN70433_348922", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "46251"}
