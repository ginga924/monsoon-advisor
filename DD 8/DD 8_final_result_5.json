By ordering 23,000 units, we can confidently cover the forecasted demand and minimize the risk of stockouts, potentially resulting in higher sales and improved customer satisfaction. Additionally, this recommendation takes advantage of the available vendor order quantity options, ensuring efficient utilization of resources. |\n", "units_to_buy": 16000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "4", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "4"}, "team_name": "DD 8", "user": "LN70433_348922", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "46251"}
