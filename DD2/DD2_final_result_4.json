This order size also allows for efficient utilization of vendor order quantities (2 x 12,500 units) and leverages the discount threshold. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 5,000 units higher than the player's planned order, which ensures a higher level of stock coverage for potential demand fluctuations. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.14 days                                |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.25 days                                |\n| Comments                          |  By adjusting the order size, we can better match the forecasted demand, reduce the risk of stockouts, and maintain an optimal inventory turnover rate.
