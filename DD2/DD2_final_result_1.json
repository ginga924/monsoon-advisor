Additionally, purchasing 20,000 units allows for achieving the discount threshold, potentially reducing costs. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is significantly larger than the player's planned 20 units. This adjustment allows for greater coverage of anticipated sales demand while leveraging the discount opportunity. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3.25 days                                |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 6 days                                   |\n| Comments                          | The recommended order size utilizes two vendor order quantities (2 x 10,000 units) for a total of 20,000 units. This approach allows for meeting the minimum purchase requirement for the discount while efficiently covering the forecasted demand.  It is recommended to reassess stock levels and adjust future orders based on actual sales data and updated forecasts. | \n", "units_to_buy": 20, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "6", "I agree with AI advice": "5", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "DD2", "user": "LN70433_348916", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "95368"}
