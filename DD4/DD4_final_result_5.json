The order size is a multiple of the available vendor order quantity (3 x 12,000) and allows for a buffer beyond the forecasted demand.  |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 5,000 units higher than the player's planned purchase, providing additional coverage for potential demand fluctuations. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 4.1 Days                                |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 8 Days (covering the forecasted 5 day period and a 3 day safety stock buffer) |\n| Comments                          | This strategy balances the need for sufficient stock while taking advantage of the discount threshold by reaching the minimum purchase quantity (27,200 units) and allowing for additional safety stock to avoid stockouts. | \n", "units_to_buy": 30000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "5", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "DD4", "user": "LN70433_348918", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "26936"}
