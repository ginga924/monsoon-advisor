This order size utilizes the vendor's available options efficiently while keeping stock levels optimal without excessive overstocking. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is significantly higher than the player's planned 1,998 units. This increase is crucial for meeting forecasted demand and minimizing the risk of stockouts. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 2.5 days                                  |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.5 days                                  |\n| Comments                          | The player's planned order size is insufficient to cover the projected demand. Increasing the order size allows for a larger safety buffer, improving the likelihood of meeting customer demand and reducing the risk of stockouts. The calculated stock turnover days are based on the current stock level and the recommended order size. | \n", "units_to_buy": 1998, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I agree with AI advice": "1 (Strongly Disagree)", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "1 (Strongly Disagree)"}, "team_name": "DD4", "user": "LN70433_348918", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "26936"}
