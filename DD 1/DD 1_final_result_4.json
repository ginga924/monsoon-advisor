This ensures a higher likelihood of meeting projected sales while minimizing the risk of stockouts. Additionally, ordering in increments of 40,000 units achieves the minimum purchase quantity required for the discount, optimizing cost savings. |\n| Comparison with Player's Plan     | The recommended order size is 25,000 units higher than the player's planned purchase. This allows for a more robust safety net in case demand exceeds expectations. |\n| Estimated Stock Turnover Days     | 3.9 days                                |\n| Forecasted Demand Coverage Days   | 5.6 days                                |\n| Comments                          | The current stock level is sufficient to cover demand for the next 5 days. However, the recommended order size prioritizes covering potential demand variability and ensures continuous stock availability. | \n", "units_to_buy": 150000, "questions": {"I relied on AI advice": "4", "I agree with AI advice": "6", "I trusted AI in the game tasks": "5"}, "team_name": "DD 1", "user": "LN70433_348915", "host": "52.74.75.79", "port": "3306", "database": "70433", "password": "34961"}
